        <h2>About Hydro Energy</h2>
        <p>Hydro energy, or hydropower, is a form of renewable energy that harnesses the power of moving water to generate electricity. It is one of the oldest and most widely used sources of renewable energy, providing clean and reliable power. Hydropower plants can vary in size from small systems suitable for local communities to large-scale projects that provide electricity to millions of people.</p>

        <h2>Installation</h2>
        <p>The installation of hydropower systems involves constructing dams or diverting water flow to drive turbines that generate electricity. Small-scale installations, such as micro-hydro systems, can be installed in streams or rivers with minimal environmental impact. Larger projects, like dam-based hydropower plants, require significant engineering and environmental considerations. Working with experts ensures the project is environmentally sustainable and economically viable.</p>

        <h2>FAQs</h2>
        <h3>What is hydro energy?</h3>
        <p>Hydro energy is energy generated by harnessing the power of moving water, typically through the use of dams or water diversion systems that drive turbines to produce electricity.</p>
        <h3>How does hydro energy work?</h3>
        <p>Hydro energy works by capturing the kinetic energy of flowing water. This energy is used to spin turbines connected to generators, which produce electricity. The process is efficient and produces no direct emissions.</p>
        <h3>What are the benefits of using hydro energy?</h3>
        <p>Hydro energy is renewable, produces no direct emissions, provides a reliable power supply, can be used for various scales of applications, and supports local economies.</p>
